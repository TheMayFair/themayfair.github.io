# themayfair.github.io
Welcome to my little corner of the web! Or, should I say, my little corner of the WebAR!
All pages on themayfair.github.io domain use AFrame, MindAR.JS, and other WebAR libraries to create fun little things!
Feel free to borrow my code and my 3D assets -- but if you /do/ borrow my stuff, just be a sweetpea and say you got it from me (Maylene Drew Ferrin) and link back to this repository (github.com/TheMayFair/themayfair.github.io).
